Time for our yearly reminder: Monsanto has not and is not working on GMO marijuana."" Nice try Monsanto, please do not pass the stuff you are smoking to us.","Our politicians are trying to dumb us down so that the elite can have better control over us. To make this goal easier for them, they have the company, Monsanto, creating genetically modified cannabis to better supply the population. Now, they can start growing the drug in mass quantities for cheaper than ever before. Then, they will hand it out to unsuspecting people for next to nothing to shackle ourselves. Their plan is perfect and despicable for how efficient it is. Stay away from marijuana before they pillage us all.

"Myth: Organics are safer than GMOs. Reality: Organic farming is a cultivation method, and GMOs are a breeding method, so it’s like comparing apples and oranges.","Organic food is king. The new millennium brings new types of crops such as GMOs. However, what if the old ways are better? Some say organics are safer than GMOs.

"Myth: GMOs are a ploy by agrichemical corporations to sell more pesticides/herbicides. Reality: Some GMO crops—such as Roundup Ready—can tolerate applications of herbicides, a trait that reduces the need for hand weeding or mechanical cultivation, which disturbs the soil. People sometimes imagine that GMOs use more insecticides, but the reverse is true with GMO crops that are bred with a natural form of insect-resistance, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to spray pesticides for crop protection.","Have you ever thought that GMOs are a ploy by agrichemical corporations to sell more pesticides/herbicides? One would think that crops would be genetically modified to have natural resistance to insects, thus eliminating the need for pesticides. This idea makes too much sense. In a capitalistic society, why would competition mandate research and development leading to the creation of a cheaper product? Nice try capitalism, not this time. "," GMOs are just the latest ploy by agrichemical corporations to sell more pesticides and herbicides. They claim they are providing us higher quality food by using GMOs. While this claim may be true, these companies are simply using GMOs as an excuse to extract more money from us consumers by sticking us with higher prices at our grocery store.","GMOs are not a ploy by agrichemical corporations to sell more pesticides/herbicides.
